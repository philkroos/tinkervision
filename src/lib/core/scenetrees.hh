/// \brief Declares the modules SceneTrees and SceneTree which manage scenes.
/// A tree is merely a view on the scenes managed. A scene itself
/// provides a manner of ordered module execution. It is implemented as
/// a linked list of instances of Node, which are wrappers around
/// the actual modules. However, multiple scenes may share the same
/// nodes. As long as the first nodes of two scenes are equal, it makes
/// sense to share the nodes between them, preventing multiple
/// executions, resource conflicts and generally have a reasonable
/// internal representation of the scenes setup.  Effectively, this
/// idea leans toward the representation of scenes merged into
/// trees. This is what this module does. A SceneTree hereby is
/// the view on related scenes (i.e. linked nodes with equal
/// beginning).  SceneTrees wraps all trees into a single
/// interface and also holds a synchronized container (SharedResource)
/// of all created nodes, including the logic of creating or destroying
/// individual nodes and linking them into the correct tree.
